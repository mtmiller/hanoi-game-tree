A somewhat optimized Python implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game,
solved using an exhaustive search of a game tree.  The optimization is
done on the internal representation of game state and action, not on the
choice of solution.

This is created as an exercise in Python programming as well as in game
tree construction and search.  Also, in the near term, to help solve a
problem on the final exam of the Stanford Online Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence.
